# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing AI Project Advisor system to include advanced features that will significantly expand its capabilities. The current system successfully provides AI project consultation using 80 curated YouTube videos as a knowledge base. This enhancement will add vector-based semantic search, conversation memory, multi-modal content support, development tool integration, real-time video processing, custom model fine-tuning capabilities, enterprise deployment features, API endpoints, and interactive learning features.

The enhanced system will transform from a simple consultation tool into a comprehensive AI development companion that can learn, adapt, and integrate deeply into development workflows while maintaining the core privacy-first, local-processing philosophy.

6. WHEN integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning independently without breaking core features
7. WHEN multiple tools are connected THEN the system SHALL provide unified insights across the entire development stack

### Requirement 5: Real-time Video Processing and Content Expansion

**User Story:** As a knowledge curator, I want to add new educational videos to the knowledge base in real-time, so that the advisor stays current with the latest AI developments and techniques.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new video URL is provided THEN the system SHALL process and integrate it into the knowledge base within 10 minutes
2. WHEN video processing occurs THEN the system SHALL use the existing 4-tier fallback method for maximum success rate
3. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically update search indices and embeddings
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL merge or skip appropriately to avoid redundancy
6. WHEN video content is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and allow rollback if needed
7. WHEN batch processing multiple videos THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow background processing

### Requirement 6: Custom Model Fine-tuning and Personalization

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want to fine-tune the AI advisor on my organization's specific knowledge and terminology, so that it provides more relevant and contextually appropriate advice for my domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom training data is provided THEN the system SHALL create domain-specific model adaptations
