# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a secure authentication system for Daily.dev MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. The current Daily.dev scraper requires manual cookie extraction and lacks secure credential storage, making it unsuitable for production MCP use. This enhancement will provide encrypted credential storage, secure authentication workflows, and seamless MCP integration while maintaining privacy and security best practices.

The system will enable users to securely authenticate with Daily.dev, store credentials with encryption, and provide MCP tools for syncing articles, bookmarks, and search results to their AI Advisor knowledge base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure Credential Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a developer using Daily.dev MCP integration, I want my authentication credentials stored securely with encryption, so that my login information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption (AES-256 or equivalent)
2. WHEN encryption is performed THEN the system SHALL use a user-provided password to derive the encryption key
3. WHEN credentials are accessed THEN the system SHALL require the correct password for decryption
4. WHEN encryption libraries are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback with basic obfuscation and clear warnings
5. WHEN credential files are created THEN the system SHALL store them in a secure location with appropriate file permissions
6. WHEN credentials expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and re-authentication prompts
7. WHEN credentials are deleted THEN the system SHALL securely remove all stored authentication data

### Requirement 2: Daily.dev Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user of the AI Advisor, I want to authenticate with Daily.dev using my existing browser session, so that I can access my personalized content and bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for extracting browser cookies
2. WHEN cookies are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them by testing API access
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store session data securely
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL detect expiration and prompt for re-authentication
6. WHEN multiple authentication methods are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most secure option
7. WHEN authentication is tested THEN the system SHALL verify access to Daily.dev's GraphQL API

### Requirement 3: MCP Server Implementation

**User Story:** As an MCP client user, I want to access Daily.dev functionality through standardized MCP tools, so that I can integrate Daily.dev content into my AI workflows seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL provide a complete set of Daily.dev tools
2. WHEN authentication tool is called THEN the system SHALL securely authenticate using stored credentials
3. WHEN sync tools are used THEN the system SHALL fetch and process Daily.dev content efficiently
4. WHEN search tools are called THEN the system SHALL query Daily.dev and return relevant results
5. WHEN bookmark tools are used THEN the system SHALL access user's personal bookmarks
6. WHEN tools fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
7. WHEN MCP client disconnects THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup resources and sessions

### Requirement 4: Content Synchronization and Processing

**User Story:** As a knowledge base curator, I want to sync Daily.dev articles to my AI Advisor knowledge base with proper metadata and categorization, so that the content is searchable and useful for consultations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN articles are synced THEN the system SHALL preserve all relevant metadata (author, tags, upvotes, etc.)
2. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate quality scores based on engagement metrics
3. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately without creating duplicates
4. WHEN sync operations run THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and completion statistics
5. WHEN errors occur during sync THEN the system SHALL continue processing other items and report errors
6. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL respect them and implement appropriate delays
7. WHEN content is added to knowledge base THEN the system SHALL integrate it with existing search and retrieval systems

### Requirement 5: Security and Privacy Protection

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all Daily.dev authentication and content processing to happen locally with strong security measures, so that my data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are processed THEN the system SHALL never transmit them to third parties
2. WHEN encryption is used THEN the system SHALL use strong, industry-standard algorithms
3. WHEN passwords are entered THEN the system SHALL use secure input methods that don't echo to screen
4. WHEN credential files are created THEN the system SHALL set restrictive file permissions (600 or equivalent)
5. WHEN authentication data is in memory THEN the system SHALL clear it when no longer needed
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages
7. WHEN the system is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL provide tools to securely remove all stored credentials

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Setup

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a simple setup process for Daily.dev authentication that guides me through the necessary steps, so that I can start using the integration quickly and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step instructions with clear explanations
2. WHEN browser cookies are needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed extraction instructions for major browsers
3. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL test the authentication and confirm it's working
4. WHEN setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and retry options
5. WHEN credentials already exist THEN the system SHALL offer options to use, replace, or delete them
6. WHEN setup is successful THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples and next steps
7. WHEN help is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation and examples

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Daily.dev MCP integration to handle errors gracefully and provide clear diagnostics, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL respect limits and queue requests appropriately
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL detect it and prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN Daily.dev API changes THEN the system SHALL handle unexpected responses gracefully
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential operations and provide warnings
6. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient detail for debugging without exposing secrets
7. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before failing

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a heavy Daily.dev user, I want the MCP integration to handle large amounts of content efficiently without impacting system performance, so that I can sync extensive article collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large sync operations run THEN the system SHALL process content in batches to avoid memory issues
2. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and queuing
3. WHEN content is cached THEN the system SHALL use efficient caching strategies to improve performance
4. WHEN background processing occurs THEN the system SHALL not block user interactions
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the system SHALL provide usage statistics and optimization suggestions
6. WHEN concurrent operations run THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data corruption
7. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and optimization recommendations
